**Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?**
I have been contracted by Artemis Financial, a financial consulting firm, to create a web application that would help them modernize their business processes. Artemis Financil offers its clients insurance, investments, retirement, and savings solutions. Their main worry is data transfer verification, and Global Rain has been contracted to create an application that will allow users to upload files and access accounts.

**What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?**
This project's ability to generate checksum values using a variety of encryption methods to guarantee data validation across security protocols was one of its strong points. No matter the size of the program, coding securely should be the top priority. Every stage of the software development life cycle should take into account protecting the company's and customers' data, particularly in this day and age when digital threats and piracy are on the rise.

**Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?**
It was particularly challenging for me to read and comprehend the vulnerability report produced by employing Maven dependency checks. I had to understand a lot of material, the majority of which I had never heard of before this course. Running dependency checks is crucial, in my opinion, particularly for apps that mostly rely on frameworks and external APIs for data collection and manipulation.

**How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?**
Using many encryption methods was the main strategy I used to add security levels to the program. Depending on the activity being done, different parts of the application call for different security strategies. For instance, certain methods are more suitable for user identity authentication, while others are simpler or more appropriate for checking the contents included in a file. For upcoming apps and projects, I find myself gravitating toward a multi-layered encryption/security strategy.

**How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?**
I examined the web application's functionality by examining each component separately before ensuring that internal and external resources were properly integrated. Running extra vulnerability tests after making any code modifications helped make sure I didn't create any more mistakes.

**What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?**
A significant portion of this project's development was creating documentation for the Spring framework and lessons on how to create and interpret vulnerability reports. Reading the documentation for a particular tool or programming language may be beneficial, in my experience, particularly when using a tool you are not yet familiar with.

**Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?**
I would present the vulnerability reports, or more precisely, the documentation and analysis I created in light of the reports' conclusions. In my opinion, comprehending security reports like that is crucial to web development, particularly for prospective employers. I feel that this assignment has led me to a greater knowledge, even though I may not be entirely sure in my ability to read and comprehend these reports.
